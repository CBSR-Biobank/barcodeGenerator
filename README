Basic Documentation for the Barcode Generator
=============================================
Definitions:

Field: Is a rectangular area that contains elements. Fields that exist in the barcode generator include:
barcode location fields, patient information fields and a logo field. Each field has elements inside it.

Element: Is an object that is placed and drawin inside a field. Elements can be a 1D barcode, 2D barcode, an image or text.
Each element has a horizontal, vertical, width, and height offset. These offsets are used to position and scale the
element within a specified field. Offset units are in millimeters.

Header: Is a virutal page seperator used in Jasper Reports. For our purposes there only exists a Title Header and
a Body Header. The Title Header encompasses the logo field and the patient information field. The Body Header 
encompasses all of the barcode fields.

Logo Field: contains an image.
Patient Info Field: contains 6 text elements and 3 1D barcode elements.
Barcode XX: contains a text element, a 1D barcode element and a 2D barocode element.


Template Editor
**********************************************

Basics: The template editor window is used to create, copy and delete templates.
Each template is composed of a "Intended Printer Name", "Jasper File"  and "Configuration Settings".
Each component within template is customizable and user editable.

"Intended Printer": This is simply a name label. It is used to help the user identify what printer 
this template was designed for, it has no functional purpose.

"Jasper File": This is a Jasper Reports based .jrxml file. By using iReports a user can customize the 
layout of the barcode locations, patient information and the logo location. If you wish to modify a 
Jasper File then you must copy a previously working copy and edit the copy through iReports. There are 
limitations to what you can do with iReports. For instance, you cannot delete fields or move a field from
the title header into the body header and vice versa. Fields can ONLY be moved within their own unique header.

"Configuration Settings": This contains a tree of field names. Each field is user-editable. It's purpose is to
allow the user to place "elements" such as 1D barcodes, 2D barcodes and text in the appropiate location within
each field. If you do not wish to set each barcode offset individually, then you can edit the Barcodes---All
elements. Barcodes----All offsets are applied to every barcode. Any additional changes to an individual barcode
will have an additive effect. For instance, if you set Barcodes---All----Barcode 1D Horizontal to 5. Then every
1D barcode in the body header will move 5mm to the right. If ontop of this change you set Barcodes---Individual
---Barcode 01---Barcode 1D Horiztonal to 6 then Barcode 01 will be moved 11mm to right, while the other barcodes
will like before be move 5mm to right.
